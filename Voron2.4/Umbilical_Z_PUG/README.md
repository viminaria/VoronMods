Based on Hartk's [Z Umbilical](https://github.com/hartk1213/MISC/tree/main/Voron%20Mods/Voron%202-Trident/2.4/Voron2.4_Z_Umbilical), made for [PUG](https://www.printables.com/model/378567-pug-parametric-umbilical-gland)

Removed the toolhead gland mount in favor of running toolhead umbilical through exhaust.
